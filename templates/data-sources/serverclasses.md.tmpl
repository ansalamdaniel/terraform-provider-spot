# {{.Name}} {{.Type}}

Used to retrieve information about the serverclasses. This data source allows you to list all the serverclasses or filter them based on specific criteria using the `filters` attribute. This can be useful when you need to programmatically determine the serverclasses.

By default, the data source returns all available serverclass names in the `names` attribute. However, you can optionally apply filters to narrow down the list based on specific criteria.

## Example Usage

The example usage shows how to retrieve the list of available serverclasses without any filters:

## Example Usage with Filters

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/spot_serverclasses/filters.example.tf" }}

In this example, the `spot_serverclasses` data source is used with a filters.

## Support for Comparator Expressions

For numeric attributes like resources.cpu, resources.memory, and other numeric attributes related to server class resources, the values attribute in the filters block supports comparator expressions. This allows you to filter server classes based on conditions like "greater than", "less than or equal to", and so on.

The comparator expressions should be provided in the following format:

- `>value` (greater than)
- `<value` (less than)
- `>=value` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=value` (less than or equal to)
- `==value` (equal to)
- `!=value` (not equal to)

For example, to filter server classes with memory greater than 8GB, you can use the expression `>8GB` in the values attribute for the resources.memory filter.
