The `spot_regions` data source is used to retrieve information about the regions. This data source allows you to list all the regions or filter the regions based on specific criteria using the `filters` attribute. This can be useful when you need to programmatically determine the regions where you want to launch cloudspaces.

By default, the data source returns all available regions in the `names` attribute. However, you can optionally apply filters to narrow down the list of regions based on specific criteria.

## Example Usage

The example usage shows how to retrieve the list of available regions without any filters:
{{ tffile .ExampleFile }}
In this example, the spot_regions data source is used without any filters. The `names` output variable will contain a list of all available region names. 

## Example Usage with Filters

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/spot_regions/country-filter.example.tf" }}
